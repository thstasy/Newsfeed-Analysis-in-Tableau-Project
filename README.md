## **Why This Project?**
This project was designed to:
- Understand how different post subtypes resonate with users.
- Identify key engagement metrics such as likes and comments.
- Provide actionable recommendations for enhancing user interaction and content relevance.

## **Key Insights and Results**

### **1. Least Favored Post Subtype in Terms of Average Likes**
- **Insight**: The **Text Post** subtype receives the lowest average likes per post, making it the least favored subtype.
   - Text posts show lower engagement compared to automated subtypes.
   - Users prefer visually engaging or achievement-based content over textual content.
   - Focused strategies can be implemented to boost interaction with text posts, such as introducing multimedia or interaction prompts.

### **2. Most and Least Common Post Types on the Newsfeed**
- **Insight**: The **Course Certificate** subtype is the most common, while **Goal** posts are the rarest.
   - Course Certificates dominate, indicating that users often share their course completions.
   - Goal posts are rare, suggesting fewer users share their achievements or track goals publicly.
   - Encouraging users to set and share goals could boost the visibility of this subtype.

### **3. Percentage of Visitors Who Actively Interacted with the Newsfeed**
- **Insight**: Only **30%** of newsfeed visitors actively engage by liking, commenting, or posting.
   - A majority of users passively consume content without direct interaction.
   - Increasing active user engagement should be a primary goal moving forward.
   - Implementing gamification or rewards for interactions could convert passive users into active participants.

### **4. Recommendations to Enhance User Interaction**
- **Insight**: To improve engagement, focus on enhancing interaction with less favored but frequent post subtypes.
   - **Text Posts**, while common, lack engagementâ€”encouraging more interactive content could improve this.
   - Consider boosting **Goal** posts through challenges or community-driven incentives.
   - Recognizing achievements through social sharing could create additional opportunities for user interaction.

### **5. Additional Insights**
- **Comment Engagement**: **Course Certificates** receive the highest number of comments, showing users resonate with achievements and are more likely to interact with accomplishment-driven content.
   - Leveraging this to encourage peer support through comments can foster stronger community engagement.
   - Introducing a feature where users can congratulate each other on achievements may further boost interactions.
